    "Most of the things you will do in this final project are explained in `Lab9` and `Lab 10`. Then, review the other labs and hws to recap the general workflow of our DS approaches to the various problems we have worked on so far. This will help you to be prepared for all the steps in this project, so that you do not miss anything. \n",

    "In gernal, you should feel free to import any package that we have previously used in class. Ensure that all plots have the necessary components that a plot should have (e.g. axes labels, a title, a legend).\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, note that this assignment is more like a project than a typical homework and it will have a slightly different structure than the hws in the past. One of the reasons why Jupyter Notebooks are so popular in the field is because you can really treat them like notebooks to explain your findings as you discover them. In this assignment, we provide some **Problem** stubs following the DS workflow and you will need to fill in the analysis and structure as you go.\n",

    "The data comes from the Kaggle which is a data science company that contains data sets on a variety of topics. This specific data is about houses in a given California district, and gives the summary stats about them based on the 1990 census data. This data set has 20640 data points and 10 features per data point. The features in the data set are longitude, latitude, housing median age, total rooms, total bedrooms, population, households, median income, median house value, and ocean proximity. All the features beside ocean_proximity are continuous numerical variables. Ocean_proximity is a categorical variable because it's represented by a string. Since this data set is about predicting house prices, I would want to explore what features have the most correlation with the median house value, and what features have the most accuracy in predicting house prices."

    "The domain of this dataset is housing prices in different California districts. We want to make regressional predictions with this data set because we're dealing with mostly numerical values, and we want to predict another numerical value by fitting a model with the necessary data to train in. From the profile report, it says that there are a total 207 missing cells, all from the total_bedrooms feature. This is important because since there are missing cells, we must clean the data to get rid of the missing cells so it doesn't skew the regressional model. From the ocean_proximity, I see that the column has 5 distinct values, so maybe there's a way to numerically categorize those 5 distinct values so I can numerically analyze them. We can also see from the profile report that median income has the highest correlation with house value."

Therefore, K-NN computes distances of different data points to a certain amount of neighbors or clusters. Then, it takes the minimum distance and classifies that data point as part of that cluster, thus making it a classification problem. On the other hand, the Linear regressional model computes the least squares to fit a best line to model, then calculates the accuracy by calculating the distance from each data point to the best fit line.\n",

    "Random Forest ensures better results than Decision tree because random forest repetitively selects a subset of features and makes a unique decision tree from that subset of features. In the end, it averages the results observed from the whole set of decision trees it created, therefore giving it better results from Decision Tree because it contains some sort of feature reduction."

    "There's a difference in performance because we used a pipeline for this one instead of hand computing it. Therefore, the pipeline does different computations based on statistical and probabilistic algorithms. The kind of feature selection being applied here is used to select the feature's importance from a model so it can be used to train another model. Therefore, since we weigh the feature's performance/importance, the r2 and rmse values are different."
